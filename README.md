Problem Statement

Children with disabilities often struggle with learning, memory, attention, and problem-solving. Cognitive retraining therapies are designed to help in these areas, but most existing solutions are clinic-based. This creates several challenges:

High costs for regular therapy sessions

Dependence on trained specialists

Frequent clinic visits, which many families cannot manage

Limited accessibility, especially in rural or low-income areas

Because of these barriers, many children are unable to access or continue therapy, leaving a gap in their developmental progress.

Proposed Solution

To address this, there is a need for an affordable, home-based, and engaging alternative. A computerized program can make therapy more accessible by:

Providing interactive and structured exercises for children

Supporting consistent practice at home

Allowing parents to track progress and encourage usage

Reducing costs and reliance on clinic visits

This approach makes cognitive retraining therapy more sustainable, inclusive, and widely available.
